# How to Ask for Help with Our Work

## Step 1

Identify whether youâ€™re stuck on the algorithmic thinking phase or the execution of the code that runs that algorithm

## Step 2

Explain what we expect to happen vs. what is actually happening

Ask questions like this:

1) Explain the failure path. What are the steps you take to encounter the problem?
2) What do you _expect_ to happen?
3) What _actually_ happens?
  Provide full error text, if available.

Sometimes questions are conceptual and don't fit the above format. That's alright.
