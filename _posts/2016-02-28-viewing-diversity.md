title: Viewing Diversity and Inclusivity in Tech
---

I consider myself lucky for the opportunities I have had throughout my life to participate in the conversation of diversity.

What I mean is that I have had some pivotal moments - profound, and impactful experiences throughout my life that have helped me formulate a framework for how to view a tremendously complex topic. 

First, I was raised in a middle class environment where I got a high quality education from diverse public schools. I lived on the cusp of the “inner city” and attended schools comprised of a higher-than-average percentage of minority students.

Additionally, my parents were by-products of‘60s counterculture, so civil rights and equality were at the foundation of our household's the bedrock of our family’s belief system.

I still vividly remember the profound impact of attending a social justice workshop in high school called Anytown, (http://nccj.org/programs-anytown). The experience brought together a diverse group of students and cultivated an unforgettable dialogue about our differences, biases, experiences, and the importance of cultivating an environment of inclusion and empowerment for all people. I still consider that experience to be one of the most formative learning experiences I have had, and it continues to shape my decision making and my perspective.

Now, as an adult a few years into my career, I am heading into class at Omaha Code School for a special group workshop on inclusivity and diversity after parsing through the thoughtful list of readings he compiled on these topics in the tech world. One of the resources was a Verge article http://www.theverge.com/2015/8/20/9179853/tech-diversity-scorecard-apple-google-microsoft-facebook-intel-twitter-amazon that presented self-published diversity reports from some of the largest companies in tech in an easy-to-read bar graph that allows you to toggle the genders and races and see the percentages of the workforce dip and grow. If you want a small taste of the magnanimity of this issue in the tech world, go there now and watch the bars shrink when you click “black” or “Hispanic.” 

I am consistently surrounded by and reminded of the importance of having this conversation, of taking part in this conversation, and of playing a role in shaping the future of inclusion in our communities.

But despite all of this, I still am challenged by the topic every single day. It is a very tricky conversation to have with others, and often even trickier to have with yourself. Inclusion and diversity is a realm where there is no one right answer, gray areas are vast, and the impossibility of pleasing all people looms large.

I am about to complete OCS training and dive deeper into the world of tech. I am grateful for the meaningful resources and conversations I have had that have equipped me for what I am about to experience. May I always remember what I learned and allow it to shape how I behave at work, as a leader, and as a member of my community.
